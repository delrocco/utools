# utools

A collection of various utilities / tool scripts (hence utools) I've written over the years.

### Requirements

Python 3  
Some scripts require specific modules like: PIL, pandas, numpy, etc.  

### Listing

| script          | description |
| :---            | :--- |
| `colorbar.py`   | generate colorbar only images w/ params |
| `delfiles.py`   | find/delete dirs of files by extension |
| `resizeimgs.py` | resize dirs of imgs respecting aspect ratio |
| `swapcols.py`   | swap 2 cols of a .csv file |
| `utility.py`    | utility script with very helpful general purpose functions |
| `oneoffs/`      | one-off scripts which served a specific purpose; provided for src ideas |   

### Notes

Sometimes I find myself needing a specific shell/Python script, but can't immediately find one online. Here are a few I've written over the years. Feel free to use or copy/paste whatever you want. Hopefully these help someone else too. Good luck!
